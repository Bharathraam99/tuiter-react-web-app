          Lemons are a citrus fruit that grow on trees and are native to Asia.
          They are widely cultivated for their acidic juice, which is used in
          cooking, baking, and as a flavoring in drinks. Lemons are rich in
          vitamin C and other antioxidants, which provide numerous health
          benefits. They are also a source of dietary fiber and contain minerals
          such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium. In addition to their
          culinary uses, lemons have been used for medicinal purposes for
          centuries, with claims ranging from curing scurvy to aiding digestion
          and improving skin health. Lemons are a versatile and flavorful fruit
          that add a refreshing tartness to many dishes and beverages.
